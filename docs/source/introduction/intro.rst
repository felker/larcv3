Introduction
=================================

Larcv is an IO and data processing framework that is specifically designed for sparse data.  Larcv was originally developed by members of the `Microboone collaboration <https://microboone.fnal.gov>`_ , a neutrino physics experiment, as they developed deep learning and computer vision applications for liquid argon time projection chambers.  The origin of the name is essentially "Liquid Argon Computer Vision"

Larcv has since split from being tied to the Mircoboone experiment, in order to be more broadly useful.  `larcv2` is the experiment agnostic implementation, which is built on the ROOT framework for data storage and python bindings.  `larcv3`, this version, is the third iteration of this concept which incorporates more modern python package design and dependencies.

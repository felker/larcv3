Installation Instructions
=================================


Dependencies
---------------------------------
Larcv is meant to be relatively easy to install.  It is written in C and C++, with python bindings generated by SWIG.  The build system is cmake integrated with python's `setup.py` interface, using the package scikit-build.  Finally, the file format and IO interface is based on hdf5.  The full list of required dependencies is:

* `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (version 3 or higher)
* `Swig <http://www.swig.org/>`_
* `scikit-build <https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* `hdf5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_
* python

larcv supports python 3+, but currently still runs with python2.  Support for python2 is not assured for all future versions, though we will do our best if there are users who need it.  

Environments
------------

larcv is meant to be flexible to install.  So in that sense, there are many ways to install and use larcv.

If you are on MacOS, mac ports is a good option.  You can install all the dependencies either with macports or pip, and install larcv directly as well.

`pip install --user larcv`

Or, if you want to speed up with a multithreaded build::

    git clone https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/larcv3.git
    cd larcv3; python setup.py install -j 12 --user

If you are on Ubuntu, installation is likely very easy via apt-get to solve dependencies.  Similarly, conda enviroments are a good way to get all dependent packages.
